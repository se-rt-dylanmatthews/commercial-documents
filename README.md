# About

This is a simple repository of various commercial documents. The files should be self explanatory. Basically this repo is just links to various submodules.

Why did we make this repository? GitLaw. That's why.

# Formatting

These documents have been formated in a specific way to be utilized with Casey's [legal_markdown gem](https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown), [Pandoc](johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html), and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) as part of an ongoing program we are doing at [Watershed](http://watershedlegal.com) that seeks to reformulate how we are practicing law.
